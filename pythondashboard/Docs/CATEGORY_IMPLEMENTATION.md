# Category Spending Analysis Dashboard Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Overview

The Category Spending Analysis Dashboard has been successfully implemented, completing **Phase 1** of the [Dashboard Roadmap](DASHBOARD_ROADMAP.md). This dashboard provides deep insights into spending patterns by category, including trend analysis, Pareto analysis (80/20 rule), and detailed category-level statistics.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Utility Functions**

#### `utils/calculations.py` - Category Analysis Functions
Added five new category-specific calculation functions:

**`calculate_category_trends()`**
- Aggregates spending by category over time
- Supports multiple periods (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- Returns time series data for trend visualization
- Handles uncategorized transactions

**`calculate_category_monthly_comparison()`**
- Calculates month-over-month spending for a specific category
- Computes absolute change and percentage change
- Useful for identifying spending increases/decreases

**`calculate_category_percentage()`**
- Calculates each category as percentage of total expenses
- Computes cumulative percentage for Pareto analysis
- Sorts categories by spending amount (descending)
- Enables 80/20 rule identification

**`get_top_transactions_by_category()`**
- Retrieves top N transactions for a specific category
- Sorted by amount descending
- Returns date, description, amount, and merchant
- Useful for drilling down into category details

**`calculate_category_statistics()`**
- Computes statistical metrics for a category
- Returns mean, median, min, max, standard deviation, and count
- Helps identify spending patterns and outliers

#### `utils/charts.py` - Category Visualization Functions
Added four new category-specific chart functions:

**`create_category_trend_chart()`**
- Multi-line chart for comparing multiple categories over time
- Supports up to 10 categories for clarity
- Interactive hover with unified x-axis
- Color-coded lines for each category

**`create_treemap_chart()`**
- Hierarchical visualization of category spending
- Color intensity based on amount
- Shows relative size and percentage
- Interactive hover with details

**`create_pareto_chart()`**
- Dual-axis chart: bars for amounts, line for cumulative %
- Highlights 80% threshold with dashed line
- Identifies which categories drive majority of spending
- Essential for prioritizing budget optimization

**`create_category_comparison_chart()`**
- Month-over-month comparison for a single category
- Bars show monthly amounts
- Line shows percentage change from previous month
- Dual y-axis for different scales

### 2. **Category Spending Analysis Dashboard** (`pages/5_üè∑Ô∏è_Categories.py`)

A comprehensive dashboard for analyzing spending patterns by category.

#### Key Features

**A. Category Overview (Summary Metrics)**

3. **Pareto Chart (Top 15 Categories)**
   - Bar chart of category spending
   - Line chart of cumulative percentage
   - 80% threshold marker
   - Identifies which categories account for 80% of spending

*Key Insight:*

4. **Top 10 Transactions Table**
   - Largest transactions in selected category
   - Columns: Date, Description, Amount, Merchant
   - Helps identify major expenses
   - Useful for finding cost-cutting opportunities

**C. All Categories Table**

*Purpose:* Complete category breakdown

*Columns:*

## API Endpoints Used

The Category Spending Analysis Dashboard uses:

- `GET /api/v1/about` - Connection test
- `GET /api/v1/transactions` - Fetch all transactions
  - Query params: `start`, `end`, `limit`, `page`
  - Filters to withdrawal type (expenses)

**Note:** Categories are extracted from transaction data, not fetched separately via category API.

## Key Calculations

### Category Percentage
```python
percentage = (category_amount / total_expenses) √ó 100
```

### Cumulative Percentage
```python
cumulative_pct = sum(percentages up to current category)
```

### Month-over-Month Change
```python
change = current_month - previous_month
change_pct = (change / previous_month) √ó 100
```

### 80% Threshold
```python
categories_80 = categories where cumulative_pct <= 80
```

---

## Key Insights & Use Cases

### Pareto Analysis (80/20 Rule)

**What it tells you:**
- Typically, 20% of categories account for 80% of spending
- These are your "high-impact" categories for budget optimization

**Example:**
- You have 20 categories total
- 7 categories account for 80% of spending (35% of categories)
- Focus budget reduction efforts on these 7 categories

**Action:** Prioritize reducing spending in categories that contribute most to your total expenses.

### Trend Analysis

**What to look for:**
- **Upward trends:** Categories where spending is increasing
- **Downward trends:** Categories where you're successfully reducing spending
- **Seasonal patterns:** Categories with predictable cycles (e.g., utilities in winter)
- **Volatility:** Categories with high month-to-month variation

**Action:** Set budgets for volatile categories, investigate increasing trends.

### Statistical Analysis

**Mean vs. Median:**
- If mean >> median: You have occasional large purchases
- If mean ‚âà median: Consistent spending pattern
- Standard deviation shows spending consistency

**Action:** High std deviation = unpredictable category, needs closer monitoring.

   - Identify redundant subscriptions

3. **Budget Integration:**

   - Show category budget vs. actual
   - Alert when category exceeds budget

4. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - Compare current month to average
   - Compare to same month last year
   - Variance analysis with explanations

5. **Smart Insights:**
   - Automatic anomaly detection ("Groceries 50% higher than usual")
   - Trend predictions ("On track to spend ‚Ç¨X this month")
   - Category recommendations ("Consider reducing Dining Out")

6. **Goal Setting:**
   - Set spending targets per category
   - Track progress toward targets
   - Celebrate achievements

7. **Custom Time Periods:**
   - Weekly analysis
   - Quarterly comparison
   - Custom fiscal year support

8. **Category Rules:**
   - Suggest auto-categorization rules
   - Identify uncategorized transactions
   - Bulk category assignment

## Troubleshooting

### "No transactions found in the selected date range"
**Solution:**
1. Adjust date range to include transactions
2. Check that you have expense transactions in Firefly III
3. Verify API connection is working

### Category shows as "Uncategorized"
**Cause:** Transactions in Firefly III don't have a category assigned

**Solution:**
1. Go to Firefly III
2. Edit transactions to assign categories
3. Refresh the dashboard

### Trends tab shows no data
**Cause:** Selected categories have no transactions in the period

**Solution:**
1. Select different categories
2. Extend the date range
3. Check if categories exist in Firefly III

### Pie chart looks cluttered
**Issue:** Too many small categories

**Solution:**
- The dashboard automatically shows only top 10 in pie chart
- Use treemap for more categories (shows top 15)
- Use Pareto chart to focus on largest categories

### Statistics show $0 or NaN
**Cause:** Category has no transactions or all transactions are $0

**Solution:** Select a different category or check data in Firefly III

## Performance Considerations

**Typical Load Times:**
- Small dataset (<1000 transactions): < 2 seconds
- Medium dataset (1000-5000 transactions): 2-5 seconds
- Large dataset (>5000 transactions): 5-10 seconds

**Optimization Tips:**
1. Use shorter date ranges for faster loading
2. Cache is set to 5 minutes - only refresh when needed
3. Category calculations are efficient (pandas groupby)
4. Consider limiting trend chart to 5-7 categories for faster rendering

---

## Integration with Other Dashboards

**Complements Budget Dashboard:**
- Budget shows spending limits per category
- Category Analysis shows actual spending patterns
- Use together to identify categories needing budget adjustments

**Complements Cash Flow Dashboard:**
- Cash Flow shows total expenses over time
- Category Analysis shows where those expenses go
- Drill down from cash flow to category details

**Workflow:**
1. Check Cash Flow for overall spending trends
2. Go to Category Analysis to identify which categories are high
3. Review Budget to see if high categories are over budget
4. Adjust spending behavior in problem categories
