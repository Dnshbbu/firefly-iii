## Overview

The Budget Dashboard has been successfully implemented as part of Phase 1 of the [Dashboard Roadmap](DASHBOARD_ROADMAP.md). This dashboard provides comprehensive budget tracking, burn rate analysis, and spending forecasts to help you stay on track with your financial goals.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Utility Functions**

#### `utils/calculations.py` - Budget Calculations
Added three new budget-specific functions:

**`calculate_budget_performance()`**
- Calculates budgeted vs. spent vs. remaining for each budget
- Computes utilization percentage
- Determines budget status (On Track, Warning, Over Budget)
- Returns comprehensive DataFrame with all budget metrics

**`calculate_budget_burn_rate()`**
- Calculates daily spending rate (burn rate)
- Projects end-of-period spending based on current rate
- Determines projected over/under budget amount
- Tracks days elapsed and days remaining

**`calculate_daily_budget_pace()`**
- Generates ideal daily budget spending curve
- Compares actual vs. ideal spending
- Provides day-by-day budget breakdown

#### `utils/charts.py` - Budget Charts
Added four new budget-specific chart functions:

**`create_budget_vs_actual_chart()`**
- Stacked bar chart showing spent + remaining
- Budget limit markers (diamonds)
- Color-coded (red for spent, green for remaining)

**`create_budget_utilization_gauges()`**
- Individual gauge charts for each budget
- Color-coded thresholds:
  - Green: 0-80% (On Track)
  - Yellow: 80-100% (Warning)
  - Red: 100%+ (Over Budget)

**`create_burn_rate_chart()`**
- Comparison of ideal daily budget vs. actual burn rate
- Color-coded bars (green if under, red if over)

**`create_budget_progress_bars()`**
- Horizontal progress bars for all budgets
- Sorted by utilization percentage
- Color-coded by status
- 100% threshold line

## API Endpoints Used

The Budget Dashboard uses the following Firefly III API endpoints:

- `GET /api/v1/about` - Connection test
- `GET /api/v1/budgets` - Fetch all budgets
- `GET /api/v1/budgets/{id}/limits` - Fetch budget limits for specific budget and date range
- `GET /api/v1/transactions` - Fetch transactions (to calculate spending per budget)

## Key Calculations

### Budget Utilization
```python
utilization_pct = (spent / budgeted) × 100
```

### Budget Status
```python
if utilization_pct >= 100:
    status = 'Over Budget'
elif utilization_pct >= 80:
    status = 'Warning'
else:
    status = 'On Track'
```

### Burn Rate
```python
burn_rate = spent / days_elapsed
```

### Projected Spend
```python
projected_spend = spent + (burn_rate × days_remaining)
```

### Projected Over/Under
```python
projected_over_under = budgeted - projected_spend
```

---

## Configuration

### Budget Status Thresholds

Current thresholds (configurable in `utils/calculations.py`):
- **On Track:** < 80% utilization
- **Warning:** 80-100% utilization
- **Over Budget:** ≥ 100% utilization

### Color Scheme

Consistent with other dashboards:
- **Green (#4ade80):** On Track, remaining budget, under burn rate
- **Yellow (#fbbf24):** Warning status, budget limit markers
- **Red (#f87171):** Over budget, spent amounts, high burn rate
- **Blue (#60a5fa):** Ideal daily budget, neutral information

---

## Limitations & Considerations

1. **Budget-Transaction Matching:**
   - Budgets are matched to transactions by `budget_name`
   - Transactions must have budget assigned in Firefly III
   - Unbudgeted transactions are not included in calculations

2. **Budget Limits:**
   - Requires budget limits to be set in Firefly III
   - If no limits exist for the period, dashboard shows warning
   - Multiple limits for same budget in same period are summed

3. **Projection Accuracy:**
   - Linear projection based on current burn rate
   - Doesn't account for irregular spending patterns
   - Most accurate for consistent spending categories

4. **Period Selection:**
   - Custom periods work but may not align with Firefly III's budget periods
   - Budget limits are fetched for exact date range requested
   - Partial periods (e.g., mid-month to mid-month) are supported but less common

5. **Multi-Currency:**
   - Currently assumes single currency (Euro €)
   - Multi-currency budgets would require additional logic
   - All amounts displayed in € regardless of actual currency

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Historical Comparison:**
   - Compare current period to previous periods
   - Trend analysis (am I improving?)
   - Seasonal pattern recognition

2. **Budget Recommendations:**
   - Suggest budget adjustments based on spending history
   - Auto-calculate realistic budgets
   - Warning if budget is too low/high

3. **Category Drilldown:**
   - Click budget to see transactions
   - Sub-category breakdown
   - Top merchants per budget

4. **Alerts & Notifications:**
   - Email/push notifications when approaching limit
   - Daily digest of budget status
   - End-of-month summary

5. **Budget Templates:**
   - Save budget configurations
   - Copy budgets from previous periods
   - Bulk budget creation

6. **What-If Scenarios:**
   - "What if I spend X more in category Y?"
   - Budget reallocation simulator
   - Savings goal impact calculator

7. **Mobile Optimization:**
   - Responsive layout for mobile devices
   - Touch-friendly gauges
   - Progressive web app (PWA)

8. **Advanced Burn Rate:**
   - Non-linear projections (curve fitting)
   - Weighted moving averages
   - Seasonal adjustments

## Troubleshooting

### "No budgets found"
**Solution:** Create budgets in Firefly III first (Budgets → Create new budget)

### "No budget limits set for the selected period"
**Solution:**
1. Go to Firefly III
2. Navigate to your budget
3. Click "Set a new budget limit"
4. Choose the period and amount

### Budget showing 0% utilization despite spending
**Possible causes:**
1. Transactions don't have budget assigned
2. Budget name mismatch (check spelling/case)
3. Transactions are outside the selected period

**Solution:** In Firefly III, edit transactions to assign them to the budget

### Burn rate seems incorrect
**Check:**
1. Period dates are correct
2. All relevant transactions are loaded
3. Days elapsed calculation (should start from period start, not today)

### Charts not displaying
**Check:**
1. Plotly is installed (`pip show plotly`)
2. Browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Try refreshing the page

## Performance Considerations

**Typical Load Times:**
- Small dataset (<10 budgets, <500 transactions): < 2 seconds
- Medium dataset (10-20 budgets, 500-2000 transactions): 2-5 seconds
- Large dataset (>20 budgets, >2000 transactions): 5-10 seconds

**Optimization Tips:**
1. Use shorter date ranges for faster loading
2. Cache is set to 5 minutes - refresh only when needed
3. Budget limit fetching is parallelizable (could be improved)
4. Consider pre-aggregating data for very large datasets

---

## Integration with Other Dashboards

**Complements Cash Flow Dashboard:**
- Cash Flow shows *what* you spent
- Budget shows *how much you planned* to spend
- Use together for complete financial picture

**Workflow:**
1. Check Cash Flow to see recent spending patterns
2. Go to Budget to verify you're within limits
3. Adjust spending behavior based on projections
4. Review both monthly for financial health
