# Cash Flow Dashboard Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Status:** âœ… Complete
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Overview

The Cash Flow Dashboard has been successfully implemented as part of Phase 1 of the [Dashboard Roadmap](DASHBOARD_ROADMAP.md). This dashboard provides comprehensive visualization and analysis of income vs. expenses over customizable time periods.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Refactored Shared Utilities** (`utils/`)

Created reusable utility modules that can be shared across all dashboards:

#### `utils/api_client.py`
Enhanced API client with comprehensive methods:
- `test_connection()` - Verify API connectivity
- `get_accounts()` - Fetch accounts with type filtering
- `get_transactions()` - Fetch transactions with pagination support
- `get_budgets()` - Fetch budget data
- `get_budget_limits()` - Fetch budget limits by date range
- `get_categories()` - Fetch categories
- `get_bills()` - Fetch bills
- `get_piggy_banks()` - Fetch piggy banks
- `parse_account_data()` - Parse account data to DataFrame
- `parse_transaction_data()` - Parse transaction data to DataFrame

**Key Features:**
- Automatic pagination for large datasets
- Proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- Type hints for better code documentation
- Date parsing and DataFrame conversion

#### `utils/charts.py`
Reusable chart creation functions using Plotly:
- `create_line_chart()` - Line charts with markers
- `create_bar_chart()` - Vertical/horizontal bar charts
- `create_combo_chart()` - Combined bar charts

- `create_stacked_area_chart()` - Stacked area charts
- `create_gauge_chart()` - Gauge/indicator charts
- `create_net_flow_chart()` - Specialized cash flow chart (income + expense bars + net line)

**Design Principles:**
- Consistent color scheme (green for positive, red for negative, blue for neutral)
- Dark mode compatible
- Configurable heights and styling
- Hover interactions enabled

#### `utils/calculations.py`
Financial calculation utilities:
- `calculate_net_worth()` - Calculate net worth by currency
- `calculate_cash_flow()` - Aggregate transactions by period (D/W/M/Q/Y)
- `calculate_category_spending()` - Aggregate expenses by category
- `calculate_income_sources()` - Aggregate income by source
- `calculate_savings_rate()` - Calculate savings as % of income
- `calculate_period_comparison()` - Compare two time periods
- `get_date_ranges()` - Generate common date ranges (month, quarter, year)

**Key Features:**
- Pandas-based aggregations for performance
- Support for multiple aggregation periods
- Handles empty data gracefully
- Period-over-period comparison logic

3. Enter your Personal Access Token (from Profile â†’ OAuth in Firefly III)
4. Click **Connect**

### 3. Select Date Range

Choose a preset range or use custom dates:
- **Preset:** Quick selection (Last 30 Days, Last 3 Months, etc.)
- **Custom:** Pick specific start and end dates

### 4. Choose Aggregation Period

Select how to group your data:
- **Daily:** Day-by-day breakdown (useful for short periods)
- **Weekly:** Week-by-week summary

## API Endpoints Used

The Cash Flow Dashboard uses the following Firefly III API endpoints:

- `GET /api/v1/about` - Connection test
- `GET /api/v1/transactions` - Fetch transactions
  - Query params: `start`, `end`, `limit`, `page`
  - Supports pagination for large datasets

## Data Flow

```
User Input (Date Range, Aggregation)
         â†“
API Client (fetch_transactions)
         â†“
Transaction Data (JSON)
         â†“
Parse to DataFrame (parse_transaction_data)
         â†“
Filter by Type (deposits, withdrawals)
         â†“
Calculate Metrics (calculate_cash_flow, calculate_category_spending, etc.)
         â†“
Create Visualizations (create_net_flow_chart, create_pie_chart, etc.)
         â†“
Display in Streamlit
```

---

## Key Calculations

### Net Cash Flow
```python
net_flow = total_income - total_expenses
```

### Savings Rate
```python
savings_rate = (net_flow / total_income) Ã— 100
```

### Average Monthly
```python
avg_monthly = total_amount / (days_in_range / 30)
```

### Cash Flow Aggregation
Uses Pandas `resample()` method:
```python
df.set_index('date').resample(period)['amount'].sum()
```

## Testing Checklist

Before using in production, test the following scenarios:

- [ ] Connection to Firefly III API succeeds
- [ ] Transactions load correctly for various date ranges
- [ ] Charts display properly with data
- [ ] Empty data scenarios show appropriate messages
- [ ] Filters work correctly
- [ ] CSV export includes correct data
- [ ] Pagination works for large transaction datasets (>500 transactions)
- [ ] Cache refreshes when clicking "Refresh Data"
- [ ] Different aggregation periods (D/W/M/Q) calculate correctly
- [ ] Multiple currencies are handled properly (if applicable)
- [ ] Dark mode styling appears correctly
- [ ] Responsive layout works on different screen sizes

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Currency:** Currently assumes single currency (Euro). Multi-currency support would require:
   - Currency conversion logic
   - Per-currency aggregation
   - Exchange rate API integration

2. **Transfers:** Transfer transactions are excluded from cash flow analysis to avoid double-counting. This is by design but may need adjustment for specific use cases.

3. **Performance:** For very large transaction datasets (>10,000 transactions), initial load may take several seconds. Consider:
   - Increasing cache TTL
   - Implementing lazy loading
   - Adding progress indicators

4. **Waterfall Chart:** Only available for monthly aggregation. Could be extended to support other periods with additional logic.

5. **Category Hierarchy:** Currently treats all categories as flat. Doesn't support parent/child category relationships.

## Dependencies

All required dependencies are already in `requirements.txt`:

```
streamlit==1.31.0
pandas==2.2.0
requests==2.31.0
plotly==5.18.0
```

No additional installations needed.

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Net Worth Dashboard Users

The API client has been refactored into `utils/api_client.py`. If you want to update the Net Worth dashboard to use the shared client:

1. Add import: `from utils.api_client import FireflyAPIClient`
2. Remove the `FireflyAPIClient` class definition from `pages/1_ðŸ“Š_Net_Worth.py`
3. Test that everything still works

This is **optional** - the Net Worth dashboard will continue to work as-is with its embedded client class.

---

## Contributing

If you add new dashboards, please:

1. Use the shared utilities in `utils/`
2. Follow the existing code style and structure
3. Include comprehensive error handling
4. Add caching for API calls
5. Use consistent dark mode styling
6. Update `Home.py` with the new dashboard description
7. Document your implementation in `Docs/`
